excerpt: "To analyze the neutronic and thermal-hydraulic performance of helical cruciform fuel (HCF) rods, numerical simulations using the CAD (computer-aided design)-based Reactor Monte Carlo code RMC and the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software Fluent were conducted, and the results were compared with those of traditional cylindrical and untwisted cruciform fuel rods. The results show that the helical cruciform structure slightly reduces the reactivity and increases the radial power peaking factor. Compared with cylindrical fuel rods, the HCF rods can enhance coolant mixing and heat transfer due to their transverse flow characteristics. In the 7-rods assembly calculation, the mean and peak temperatures of HCF rods are reduced by about 4 K."
